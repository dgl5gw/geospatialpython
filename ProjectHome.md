Sample projects and libraries from [GeospatialPython.com](http://www.GeospatialPython.com)

Sample data and some scripts used in the examples on [GeospatialPython.com](http://www.GeospatialPython.com) can be found in the [Downloads](http://code.google.com/p/geospatialpython/downloads/list) section.  Most sample source code is located in the [Subversion Repository](http://code.google.com/p/geospatialpython/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk).

A good bit of the examples are based on the the [Python Shapefile Library](http://code.google.com/p/pyshp/) also hosted on Google Code.

There is a discussion group for everything above on [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/geospatialpython).
